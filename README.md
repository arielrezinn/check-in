# Check-In, A Chrome Extension for COVID
The Chrome Extension for Mental Health in the Age of COVID-19

# Problem
As college students, we noticed that quarantine has blocked off most people's main outlet for emotional guidance: friends. There's a need for being in touch with your emotions now more than ever.
 
# Why Mood Map?
That's where Check-In comes to help. Our Chrome Browser extension integrates mood check ups to your daily life.Through Mood Map, people can see trends within their moods and stay on top of their emotions.
 
 
 
# Technology Used
We used Grommet, a React based framework, Firebase for our backend user authentication portal, etc.
