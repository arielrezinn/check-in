## Problem
As college students, we've noticed that quarantine has significantly changed our lives. **Our screen time is now higher than ever** as we rely on the Internet for everything from classes to communicating with friends. This means that **it can be hard to find a quick moment** for introspection and self-reflection.
 
## Why Mood Map?
Our web app integrates mood check ups into your daily life in order to reconnect you with your inner emotions. Every time you open up a new tab, Mood Map gives you a moment to reflect on how you, the person sitting in front of the computer, are doing. This gives you a brief respite from the ongoing hustle of Zoom meetings and coursework and everything else you might have going on.

Through Mood Map, **the user can see trends in their moods** over the course of time, helping them to connect with and understand their emotions not only by logging them, but also by **seeing data visualizations**.
